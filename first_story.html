        A Rooted Being

        <span>
            Today, I awoke.
        </span>

        <span>
            To clarify, I do not recall having been asleep. My sleep is my death, forgotten until I once again
            bloom
            back
            into being. From a boreal nothing to an arboreal something, I am part of a cycle I cannot
            comprehend. I
            grow,
            remember, and witness, weaving my existence on a loom made of my own bones and boscage. A full year
            has
            been
            carved into me, another concentric circle.
        </span>

        <span>
            Even though the winter has all but died, its ghost still haunts my forest. Crocuses dare to unfurl
            in
            the
            tentative balminess. Rivets of water trapped under thin veils of ice slowly coalesce around every
            trapped
            bubble, appearing almost alive. A creature creeps low to the ground in a noon-baked puddle of
            sunlight,
            her
            fur
            brindled by the shadows of grass around her. She has teeth that are longer, sharper, and harder than
            even
            the
            prickliest of pine needles. I can feel her hunger through subtle hums and churning in her stomach
            that
            reverberate through the soil and into my roots. Her need for violence is not one born of hatred but
            of
            need
            as
            she bears down on her unsuspecting target: another albeit smaller creature, with ears longer than
            maple
            leaves
            and a tail of cotton. Her hunger for this creature makes her salivate into my soil, where it is in
            turn
            hungrily
            suckled by my roots. In a flash, she strikes. Tufts of fur shoot through the air; these are carried
            away
            on
            a
            cool breeze like so many dandelion seeds. Blood soaks the soil and feeds my roots even more, but
            this
            time
            it is
            a metallic elixir, a viscous deluge of cherry red. It pools together while she tears through fiber
            and
            sinew,
            ignorant of the ticks inhabiting the forest of her fur. As she eats, she feeds them in turn.

            As spring takes root, an apprehensive four-hoofed being, legs as slim and flexible as saplings,
            ventures
            into my
            sight. She struggles across and collapses in a thicket just within the border of my clearing. She
            hasn’t
            traveled far, but the effort is more than taxing. I feel her anguished yet confident heartbeat
            drumming
            through
            her bloodstream as it reverberates through my roots. Suddenly, I notice two other heartbeats, like a
            fluttering
            echo to her rich pulse. As she struggles and kicks, the earth around her is suddenly drenched in
            water
            and
            blood
            and afterbirth, acrid and sour; my roots drink it in greedily. Suddenly, the muck gives way to two
            creatures
            who
            writhe in this little flood that spills forth from her. In that placental ambrosia, one little
            heartbeat
            goes
            silent forever. As milk flows from the hoofed mother to her lonely and famished son, hungry,
            writhing
            worms
            slowly venture upwards. They seek to claim his twin as their own—hooves, bones, and all.
        </span>

        <span>
            While I witness this, I feel a heady aroma surround me. My sap almost feels imbued with the scent as
            it
            travels
            through the veins beneath my bark. A carpet of daffodils rolls out from my feet, each yellow cup
            breathing
            out a
            xanthous haze of amber. Little striped beings hover and examine each cup of ambrosia, greedily
            sipping
            its
            sweetness. They drunkenly fly off on diaphanous wings that can barely hold them, wearing little
            slippers
            of
            pollen. They are at the mercy of the wind as they struggle to deliver their saccharine reward to
            their
            regent.
            She has made a diminutive castle in my branches, and my leaves are her mote.

        </span>

        <span>
            Summer slowly saunters in. There is an evening that is so hot and humid that my leaves glisten and
            glow.
            I
            look
            down through my foliage at a bewildering sight: Two flat-footed lovers entwined with each other,
            gasping
            and
            shuddering. Their limbs are like roots, twisting and twirling through and within each other. I feel
            the
            ephemeral steam rise from their skin as they hasten. The liquid sustenance that drips and pools from
            their
            ecstasy, salty and alkaline, is hungrily absorbed through the flattened soil where they climax. My
            roots
            drink
            deeply.
        </span>


        <span>
            Summer is now almost outstaying its welcome. As the heat stretches on like a humid inferno, my worms
            continue
            their little feast on the silent one and his little hooves. His bones are now a putrescent
            cornucopia
            for
            creatures of air, who fly in on limbs of feather, cuticle, and membrane. The fetid banquet ends with
            a
            nascent
            chill. The cold will soon come knocking. I stand like a sentinel as all this unfolds.
        </span>

        <span>
            As autumn announces itself, I observe a large, hulking boulder of a creature waddling through the
            thicket
            and
            into my clearing. A tang of salmon, berries, and musk emanates from his fur. He is blissful and
            unconcerned
            as
            he passes under my shade, and I feel the weight of satiation within him. He had eaten far past
            excess,
            his
            fat
            stretching under his skin and over his pulsating musculature. Sleepy and indifferent to me, he
            presses
            on
            like a
            slow and lazy tumbleweed, seeking a slumber that will outlast the cold. He takes a pause at my
            doorstep,
            releasing a steady stream of urine as sour as an unripe berry. My roots are yet again watered.
        </span>


        <span>
            I now look inward through my own body, past its bark, feeling little rivers of sap grow cold and
            harden—a
            harbinger of an end.
        </span>

        <span>

            A growing acorn of rebelliousness is entrenched within me. As winter draws near, that defiance only
            grows. I
            know that my leaves, green and verdant, will not last forever. They will soon become brown and
            brittle;
            dead,
            dun, and dry. They will be nothing but a means of cutting a rustling sound through the long silence
            as
            their
            dry
            corpses are carried away. They will be reduced to nothing but a crunch underfoot, trampled by
            hooves,
            feet,
            and
            claws. My arms grow enraged and fractalize into a furious whirlwind of color. It is a dying
            explosion of
            yellow,
            orange, and red, a reminder of the destructive nature of fire. They are daring to defy the quiet
            approach,
            for
            their colors are defiance itself.
        </span>

        <span>
            If this is to be the last of us, I will stay rooted, tall, and proud, reminding all that I will
            return.
            Higher
            next time, broader, with hungry tendrils meandering even further down through soil to seek out water
            and
            ichor.
            Traveling heavenward, I will devour all that the sun will grant me. The blinding sun above and
            blinded
            worms
            below, both blind to each other, will tether me to my earth. My cycle has ended; I won’t remember
            next
            time
            I
            wake. It is time to discard my dendriform crown and wait for the next concentric circle to form.
            And I will not recall any of this.
        </span>
